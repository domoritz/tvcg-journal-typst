# tvcg-journal-typst

A Typst template for TVCG journals. This is work in progress and not yet ready. This project was started by MatÄ›j Lang at https://typst.app/project/pdh8Qj4vO7tfB1oiWoHuez. Please help us finish it to look as close as possible to the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/ieeevgtc/tvcg-journal-latex).

## Development

First, link the current directory as a [Typst local package](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages) with `link.sh` so that the template can be used in a local project.

Then run `typst compile template/main.typ --root template/` to compile the template against the development version of the package. If you want to use the released version of the tvcg-journal package, delete the local symlink.
